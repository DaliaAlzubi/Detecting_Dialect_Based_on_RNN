# Detecting_Dialect_Based_on_RNN
The work on classifying these dialects is an interesting area of research, as it has implications for other areas, such as; sentiment analysis and machine translation. In this paper, we build a multi-classification model for dialects based on utilizing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approaches, where the dialects are classified into four categories, namely; Maghreb, Levantine, Gulf (in addition to Iraqi), and the Nile. The used dataset is taken from the MADAR corpus, which contained 110,000 sentences, which belong to dialects of different countries in the four regions. Based on experimentations, the results showed that the classifiers are able to distinguish between the four dialects with an accuracy of up to 84.76%, which in turn considered a promising result in this field.
